# fast-ssdeep-clus : Parallel ssdeep clustering kit

## What is this?

This is simple and efficient ssdeep-based clustering program. I use this
program to cluster my malware collection (based on certain threshold value).

## What is ssdeep clustering mode?

ssdeep 2.9 or later implements simple clustering mode.

  * If digest `A` and digest `B` are similar enough, `A` and `B` are in the same cluster.
  * If `A` and `B` are similar enough and `B` and `C` also are, all `A`, `B` and `C` are in the same cluster (even if `A` and `C` are NOT similar enough).

Based on the threshold value `t`, two digests are treated as "similar" if the
similarity score of them is greater than `t`.

If you are familiar with clustering, you can see that this is just single-
linkage clustering with a fixed distance value.

## Requirements

  * ffuzzy++ 4.0  
<https://github.com/a4lg/ffuzzypp>

There's no Makefile because this entire program is a hack. Please build it
yourself.

## File Format : Fuzzy hash list

This is simple fuzzy hash list separated by newline character.

    
    
    3::
    24:VGXGP7L5e/Ixt3af/WKPPaYpzg4m3XWMCsXNCRs0:kYDxcfPZpelCs9Cm0
    24:3G24hjRrxvF61IJG1XNgf+ojDOja9/JTjw1UBr2mk:W5FhnVtajaRG1gr2r
    (... continues without empty lines ...)
    (EOF)
    

## File Format : Cluster list

It indicates which fuzzy hashes are connected. If fuzzy hash `A` and `B` are
connected and `C`, `D`, `E` are connected, the cluster list should look like
this:

    
    
    A
    B
    (empty line)
    C
    D
    E
    (empty line)
    (EOF)
    

There is always an empty line after each cluster to indicate end of cluster.

## Program : fast-ssdeep-clus

  * Input: fuzzy hash list (as first argument)
  * Output: cluster list (to `stdout`)

This program clusters fuzzy hashes and makes cluster list.

## Program : fast-combine-ssdeep-clus

  * Input 1: fuzzy hash list (as first argument)
  * Input 2: fuzzy hash list (as second argument)
  * Output: cluster list (to `stdout`)

This program tries to make clusters between elements in Input 1 and elements
in Input 2. This program is useful for making clusters gradually.

## Program : combine-clusters

  * Input: cluster list (from `stdin`)
  * Output: cluster list (to `stdout`)

This program combines clusters. For instance, if input like this is given...:

    
    
    A
    B
    (empty line)
    C
    D
    E
    (empty line)
    B
    C
    (empty line)
    (EOF)
    

the output should look like this:

    
    
    A
    B
    C
    D
    E
    (empty line)
    (EOF)
    

Because all five elements are connected (indirectly), this program combines
all connected clusters into a single cluster.

## Program : sort-clusters

  * Input: cluster list (from `stdin`)
  * Output: cluster list (to `stdout`)

This program normalizes output by sorting cluster list on certain order.

## Usage

    
    
    # threshold = 79, number of threads = 8
    
    # Make cluster list:
    $ fast-ssdeep-clus -t 79 -n 8 all.ssdeep | sort-clusters >all.clusters.79.txt
    
    # Make clusters gradually:
    # assuming that all.ssdeep and delta.ssdeep does not intersect (have no common elements)
    $ fast-ssdeep-clus -t 79 -n 8 delta.ssdeep >delta.clusters.79.0
    $ fast-combine-ssdeep-clus -t 79 -n 8 delta.ssdeep all.ssdeep >delta.clusters.79.1
    $ cat all.clusters.79.txt delta.clusters.79.0 delta.clusters.79.1 \
    	| combine-clusters | sort-clusters >all.clusters.79.txt.new
    $ mv all.clusters.79.txt.new all.clusters.79.txt
    $ cat delta.ssdeep >>all.ssdeep
