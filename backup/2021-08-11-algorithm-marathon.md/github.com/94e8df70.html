##  README

    
    
    Pystring is a collection of C++ functions which match the interface and behavior of python's string class methods using std::string. Implemented in C++, it does not require or make use of a python interpreter. It provides convenience and familiarity for common string operations not included in the standard C++ library. It's also useful in environments where both C++ and python are used.
    
    Overlapping functionality (such as index and slice/substr) of std::string is included to match python interfaces.
    
    Originally developed at Sony Pictures Imageworks.
    <http://opensource.imageworks.com/>
    
    Note: Despite the infrequent updates, this repo is not dead/abandoned - just stable!  We use it every day at Imageworks.
