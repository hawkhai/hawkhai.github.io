SMHasher is a test suite designed to test the distribution, collision, and
performance properties of non-cryptographic hash functions. Updates 1/8/2016

##  README.md

## [SMHasher](https://github.com/aappleby/smhasher/wiki) is a test suite
designed to test the distribution, collision, and performance properties of
non-cryptographic hash functions.

This is the home for the
[MurmurHash](https://github.com/aappleby/smhasher/tree/master/src) family of
hash functions along with the
[SMHasher](https://github.com/aappleby/smhasher/tree/master/src) test suite
used to verify them. SMHasher is released under the MIT license. All
MurmurHash versions are public domain software, and the author disclaims all
copyright to their code.

SMHasher is a test suite designed to test the distribution, collision, and
performance properties of non-cryptographic hash functions - it aims to be the
[DieHarder](http://www.phy.duke.edu/~rgb/General/dieharder.php) of hash
testing, and does a pretty good job of finding flaws with a number of popular
hashes.

The SMHasher suite also includes
[MurmurHash3](https://github.com/aappleby/smhasher/blob/master/src/MurmurHash3.cpp),
which is the latest version in the series of MurmurHash functions - the new
version is faster, more robust, and its variants can produce 32- and 128-bit
hash values efficiently on both x86 and x64 platforms.

## Updates

### 1/8/2016

Woo, we're on Github! I've been putting off the migration for a few, uh, years
or so, but hopefully Github won't be shutting down any time soon so I don't
have to move things again. MurmurHash is still used all over the place,
SMHasher is still the defacto hash function test suite, and there are all
sorts of interesting new hash functions out there that improve bulk hashing
speed and use new shiny hardware instructions for AES and whatnot. Interesting
times. :)

I've copied the few wiki pages from code.google.com/p/smhasher to this wiki,
though I haven't reformatted them to Markdown yet. The MurmurHash page on
Wikipedia should also be linking here now as well. Feel free to send me pull
requests.
