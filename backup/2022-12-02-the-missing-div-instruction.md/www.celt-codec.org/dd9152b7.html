<h1>The CELT ultra-low delay audio codec</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
        The CELT codec is a compression algorithm for audio. Like MP3, Vorbis, and 
        AAC it is suitable for transmitting music with high quality. Unlike these    
        formats CELT imposes very little delay on the signal, even less than is
        typical for speech centric formats like Speex, GSM, or G.729.
</p>
<p>
        Using CELT application developers can build software that allows musicians to
        perform together across the Internet, or simply build great sounding
        telephony systems. Why shouldn't your telephone sound as good as your
        stereo?
</p>
<p>
        Like other open and unencumbered technology from the Xiph.Org Foundation CELT
        requires no royalties and no complicated licensing.
</p>
<h2>The Technology</h2>
<p>
	CELT stands for "Constrained Energy Lapped Transform". It applies some of the CELP principles,
        but does everything in the frequency domain, which removes some of the limitations of CELP.
        CELT is suitable for both speech and music and currently features:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Ultra-low latency (typically from 5 to 22.5 ms) </li>
	<li>Full audio bandwidth (≥20kHz; sample rates from 8 kHz to 48 kHz)</li>
	<li>Support for both speech and music</li>
	<li>A quality/bitrate trade-off competitive with widely used high delay codecs</li>
	<li>Stereo support</li>
	<li>Packet loss concealment</li>
	<li>Constant bit-rates from 32 kbps to 128 kbps and above</li>
	<li>A fixed-point version of the encoder and decoder</li>
</ul>
<p>
	The CELT codec is meant to bridge the gap between Vorbis and Speex for applications
	where both high quality audio and low delay are desired.
</p>
<h2>Getting Involved</h2>
<p>
	CELT is still in an early state of development. At this point, two ways of getting involved are:
        helping design the algorithm (requires strong DSP knowledge) or building applications using
        CELT. Your feedback can help define the future direction the codec will take.
</p>
<p>
        <b>Since CELT is still in development, most new releases (even minor ones) change the bit-stream,
        so compatibility is not preserved.</b> This instability is why CELT is currently called <i>experimental</i>.
        The ability to change the format is important in allowing us to make quality improvements while we
        develop CELT. Once version 1.0 is released the bitstream will be frozen and future revisions will be
        compatible.
</p>
<p>
	If you are interested in using CELT privately, among people who can coordinate CELT versions, in
	non-interoperable embedded applications, or are doing software development in preparation for the
        final version then the instability of the bitstream should not be a problem for you and we'd like your
	feedback. However, for major public adoption CELT will need to reach 1.0.  
</p>
<p> 
	If you have questions or are interested in contributing to the project, you can join the mailing list. 
	You can also contact the Project Lead, Jean-Marc Valin
	(the mailing list is usually preferable).

      <h3>Version 0.11.0 and 0.11.1 released</h3>
      <p class="submitdate">15 February, 2011</p>
      <div class="description">
                <p>CELT 0.11.0 (originally not announced) and 0.11.1 has been released with a focus on freezing the bit-stream and updating the API. The bit-stream is now in "soft-freeze" state meaning there is an attempt to keep it fixed, but some bugs may force changes. Version 0.11 includes some minor quality improvements, mostly at high bit-rate. In version 0.11.1, some minor changes to the bit-stream were necessary to address two minor bugs in 0.11. The quality should improve (very) slightly, but not enough to be noticeable in most cases. Several Opus-related bugs have also been fixed.</p>

      <h3>Version 0.10.0 released</h3>
      <p class="submitdate">21 December, 2010</p>
      <div class="description">
                <p>CELT 0.10.0 has been released with a focus on quality improvements. The bit-stream is <b>not</b> compatible with version 0.9.x. See Monty's CELT demo page for more details on recent (and less recent) CELT development.</p>
      </div>

   <li>
      <h3>Version 0.9.1 released</h3>
      <p class="submitdate">8 November, 2010</p>
      <div class="description">
                <p>CELT 0.9.1 greatly improves the packet loss concealment.
                   This change is especially dramatic in fixed point mode. The bit-stream is compatible with 0.9.0.</p>
