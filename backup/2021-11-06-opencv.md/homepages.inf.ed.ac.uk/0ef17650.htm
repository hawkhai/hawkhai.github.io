</p><h2>Brief Description</h2>

<p><a name="2"><img alt="" src="mote.gif" /></a>The Fourier Transform is an
important image processing tool which is used to decompose an image
into its sine and cosine components. The output of the transformation
represents the image in the <em>Fourier</em> or <a href="freqdom.htm">frequency
domain</a>, while the input image is the <a href="spatdom.htm">spatial domain</a>
equivalent. In the Fourier domain image, each point represents a
particular frequency contained in the spatial domain image.

</p><p>The Fourier Transform is used in a wide range of applications, such as
image analysis, image filtering, image reconstruction and image
compression.

</p><p><a name="how"><img alt="" src="mote.gif" /></a></p><h2>How It Works</h2>

<p>As we are only concerned with digital images, we will restrict this
discussion to the <em>Discrete Fourier Transform</em> (DFT).

</p><p>The DFT is the sampled Fourier Transform and therefore does not
contain all frequencies forming an image, but only a set of samples
which is large enough to fully describe the spatial domain image. The
number of frequencies corresponds to the number of pixels in the spatial
domain image, <em>i.e.</em> the image in the spatial and Fourier domain are of the
same size.

</p><p>For a square image of size N×N, the two-dimensional DFT is given by:

</p><p></p><blockquote>
<!-- <IMG ALT="Eqn:eqnfour1" SRC="eqns/eqnfour1.png" align="bottom"> -->
<img alt="Eqn:eqnfour1" src="eqns/fowdfft2.gif" align="bottom" />
</blockquote>

<p>where <em>f(a,b)</em> is the image in the spatial domain and the exponential
term is the basis function corresponding to each point <em>F(k,l)</em> in
the Fourier space. The equation can be interpreted as: the value of
each point <em>F(k,l)</em> is obtained by multiplying the
spatial image with the corresponding base function and summing the
result.

</p><p>The basis functions are sine and cosine waves with increasing frequencies, <em>i.e.</em> <em>F(0,0)</em> represents the DC-component of the image which corresponds to the average brightness and <em>F(N-1,N-1)</em> represents the highest frequency.
 

</p><p>In a similar way, the Fourier image can be re-transformed to the
spatial domain. <a name="3"><img alt="" src="mote.gif" /></a>The inverse Fourier
transform is given by:

</p><p></p><blockquote>
<img alt="Eqn:eqnfour2" src="eqns/eqnfour2.png" align="bottom" />
</blockquote>


<p>Note the <img alt="Eqn:oneovern2" src="eqns/oneovern2.gif" align="middle" />  normalization term in the inverse transformation.
This normalization is sometimes applied to the forward transform instead of the
inverse transform, but it should not be used for both.$$



</p><p>To obtain the result for the above equations, a double sum has to be
calculated for each image point. However, because the Fourier Transform is
<em>separable</em>, it can be written as
</p><blockquote>
<img alt="Eqn:eqnfour3" src="eqns/eqnfour3.png" align="bottom" />
</blockquote> where <blockquote>
<img alt="Eqn:eqnfour4" src="eqns/eqnfour4.png" align="bottom" />
</blockquote>
Using these two formulas, the spatial domain image is first transformed
into an intermediate image using <em>N</em> one-dimensional Fourier
Transforms. This intermediate image is then transformed into the final
image, again using <em>N</em> one-dimensional Fourier
Transforms. Expressing the two-dimensional Fourier Transform in terms
of a series of <em>2N</em> one-dimensional transforms decreases the number
of required computations.

<p><a name="4"><img alt="" src="mote.gif" /></a>Even with these computational
savings, the ordinary one-dimensional DFT has <img alt="Eqn:eqnfour6" src="eqns/eqnfour6.gif" align="middle" />
complexity. This can be reduced to <img alt="Eqn:eqnfour5" src="eqns/eqnfour5.gif" align="middle" /> if
we employ the <em>Fast Fourier Transform</em> (FFT) to compute the one-dimensional
DFTs. This is a significant improvement, in particular for
large images. There are various forms of the FFT and most of them
restrict the size of the input image that may be transformed, often to
<img alt="Eqn:eqnfour7" src="eqns/eqnfour7.gif" align="middle" /> where <em>n</em> is an integer. The mathematical
details are well described in the literature.

</p><p>The Fourier Transform produces a complex number valued output image
which can be displayed with two images, either with the <em>real</em>
and <em>imaginary</em> part or with <em>magnitude</em> and <em>phase</em>. In
image processing, often only the magnitude of the Fourier Transform is
displayed, as it contains most of the information of the geometric
structure of the spatial domain image. However, if we want to re-transform
the Fourier image into the correct spatial domain after some processing in
the frequency domain, we must make sure to preserve both magnitude and
phase of the Fourier image.

</p><p>The Fourier domain image has a much greater range than the image in
the spatial domain. Hence, to be sufficiently accurate, its values are
usually calculated and stored in float values.

</p><p>
<a name="guidelines"><img alt="" src="mote.gif" /></a></p><h2>Guidelines for Use</h2>

<p>The Fourier Transform is used if we want to access the geometric
characteristics of a spatial domain image. Because the image in the
Fourier domain is decomposed into its sinusoidal components, it is
easy to examine or process certain frequencies of the image, thus
influencing the geometric structure in the spatial domain.

</p><p>In most implementations the Fourier image is shifted in such a way that the
DC-value (<em>i.e.</em> the image mean) <em>F(0,0)</em> is displayed in the center
of the image. The further away from the center an image point is, the
higher is its corresponding frequency.

</p><p>We start off by applying the Fourier Transform of

</p><blockquote><a href="images/cln1.gif"><img alt="cln1" src="thumbs/cln1.GIF" /></a></blockquote>
<p> The magnitude calculated from the complex
result is shown in 
</p><blockquote><a href="images/cln1fur1.gif"><img alt="cln1fur1" src="thumbs/cln1fur1.GIF" /></a></blockquote>
<p> We can see that the
DC-value is by far the largest component of the image. However, the
dynamic range of the Fourier coefficients (<em>i.e.</em> the intensity values in
the Fourier image) is too large to be displayed on the screen,
therefore all other values appear as black. If we apply a
<a href="pixlog.htm">logarithmic transformation</a> to the image we obtain

</p><blockquote><a href="images/cln1fur2.gif"><img alt="cln1fur2" src="thumbs/cln1fur2.GIF" /></a></blockquote>
<p> The result shows that the image contains
components of all frequencies, but that their magnitude gets smaller
for higher frequencies. Hence, low frequencies contain more image
information than the higher ones. The transform image also tells us
that there are two dominating directions in the Fourier image, one
passing vertically and one horizontally through the center. These
originate from the regular patterns in the background of the original
image.

</p><p>The phase of the Fourier transform of the same image is shown in

</p><blockquote><a href="images/cln1fur3.gif"><img alt="cln1fur3" src="thumbs/cln1fur3.GIF" /></a></blockquote>
<p> The value of each point determines the
phase of the corresponding frequency. As in the magnitude image, we
can identify the vertical and horizontal lines corresponding to the
patterns in the original image. The phase image does not yield much
new information about the structure of the spatial domain image;
therefore, in the following examples, we will restrict ourselves to
displaying only the magnitude of the Fourier Transform.

</p><p>Before we leave the phase image entirely, however, note that if we
apply the inverse Fourier Transform to the above magnitude image while
ignoring the phase (and then <a href="histeq.htm">histogram equalize</a> the
output) we obtain 
</p><blockquote><a href="images/cln1fil1.gif"><img alt="cln1fil1" src="thumbs/cln1fil1.GIF" /></a></blockquote>
<p> Although this image contains
the same frequencies (and amount of frequencies) as the original input
image, it is corrupted beyond recognition. This shows that the phase
information is crucial to reconstruct the correct image in the spatial
domain.

</p><p>We will now experiment with some simple images to better
understand the nature of the transform. The response of the Fourier
Transform to periodic patterns in the spatial domain images can be seen
very easily in the following artificial images.

</p><p>The image 
</p><blockquote><a href="images/stp2.gif"><img alt="stp2" src="thumbs/stp2.GIF" /></a></blockquote>
<p> shows 2 pixel wide vertical stripes. The magnitude of the
Fourier transform of this image is shown in

</p><blockquote><a href="images/stp2fur1.gif"><img alt="stp2fur1" src="thumbs/stp2fur1.GIF" /></a></blockquote>
<p> If we look carefully, we can see that it
contains 3 main values: the DC-value and, since the Fourier image is
symmetrical to its center, two points corresponding to the frequency
of the stripes in the original image. Note that the two points lie on
a horizontal line through the image center, because the image
intensity in the spatial domain changes the most if we go along it
horizontally.

</p><p>The distance of the points to the center can be explained as follows:
the maximum frequency which can be represented in the spatial domain are
two pixel wide stripe pairs (one white, one black).
</p><blockquote>
<img alt="Eqn:eqnfour8" src="eqns/eqnfour8.gif" align="bottom" />
</blockquote> Hence, the two pixel wide stripes in the
above image represent <blockquote>
<img alt="Eqn:eqnfour9" src="eqns/eqnfour9.gif" align="bottom" />
</blockquote> Thus, the points in the Fourier
image are halfway between the center and the edge of the image, <em>i.e.</em>
the represented frequency is half of the maximum.

<p>Further investigation of the Fourier image shows that the magnitude of
other frequencies in the image is less than
<img alt="Eqn:eqnfoura" src="eqns/eqnfoura.gif" align="middle" /> of the DC-value, <em>i.e.</em> they don't make
any significant contribution to the image.  The magnitudes of the two
minor points are each two-thirds of the DC-value.

</p><p>Similar effects as in the above example can be seen when applying the
Fourier Transform to 
</p><blockquote><a href="images/stp1.gif"><img alt="stp1" src="thumbs/stp1.GIF" /></a></blockquote>
<p> which consists of diagonal
stripes. In 
</p><blockquote><a href="images/stp1fur1.gif"><img alt="stp1fur1" src="thumbs/stp1fur1.GIF" /></a></blockquote>
<p> showing the magnitude of the Fourier
Transform, we can see that, again, the main components of the
transformed image are the DC-value and the two points corresponding to
the frequency of the stripes. However, the logarithmic transform of the
Fourier Transform, 
</p><blockquote><a href="images/stp1fur2.gif"><img alt="stp1fur2" src="thumbs/stp1fur2.GIF" /></a></blockquote>
<p> shows that now the image
contains many minor frequencies. The main reason is that a
diagonal can only be approximated by the square pixels of the image,
hence, additional frequencies are needed to compose the image. The
logarithmic scaling makes it difficult to tell the influence of single
frequencies in the original image. To find the most important
frequencies we <a href="threshld.htm">threshold</a> the original Fourier magnitude image at
level 13. The resulting Fourier image, 
</p><blockquote><a href="images/stp1fur3.gif"><img alt="stp1fur3" src="thumbs/stp1fur3.GIF" /></a></blockquote>
<p> shows all
frequencies whose magnitude is at least 5% of the main peak. Compared
to the original Fourier image, several more points appear. They are
all on the same diagonal as the three main components, <em>i.e.</em> they all
originate from the periodic stripes. The represented frequencies are
all multiples of the basic frequency of the stripes in the spatial domain
image. This is because a rectangular signal, like the stripes, with
the frequency <img alt="Eqn:eqnfourb" src="eqns/eqnfourb.gif" align="middle" /> is a composition of sine waves
with the frequencies <img alt="Eqn:eqnfourc" src="eqns/eqnfourc.gif" align="middle" />,
known as the harmonics of <img alt="Eqn:eqnfourb" src="eqns/eqnfourb.gif" align="middle" />. All other
frequencies disappeared from the Fourier image, <em>i.e.</em> the magnitude of
each of them is less than 5% of the DC-value.

</p><p><a name="5"><img alt="" src="mote.gif" /></a>A Fourier-Transformed
image can be used for <a href="freqfilt.htm">frequency filtering</a>.
A simple example is illustrated with the above image. If we multiply
the (complex) Fourier image obtained above with an image containing a
circle (of <em>r</em> = <em>32</em> pixels), we can set all frequencies larger than
<img alt="Eqn:eqnfourb" src="eqns/eqnfourb.gif" align="middle" /> to zero as shown in the logarithmic
transformed image 
</p><blockquote><a href="images/stp1fur5.gif"><img alt="stp1fur5" src="thumbs/stp1fur5.GIF" /></a></blockquote>
<p> By applying the inverse
Fourier Transform we obtain 
</p><blockquote><a href="images/stp1fil1.gif"><img alt="stp1fil1" src="thumbs/stp1fil1.GIF" /></a></blockquote>
<p> The resulting
image is a lowpass filtered version of the original spatial domain
image. Since all other frequencies have been suppressed, this result
is the sum of the constant DC-value and a sine-wave with the frequency
<img alt="Eqn:eqnfourb" src="eqns/eqnfourb.gif" align="middle" />. Further examples can be seen in the
worksheet on <a href="freqfilt.htm">frequency filtering</a>.

</p><p>A property of the Fourier Transform which is used, for example, for
the removal of additive <a href="noise.htm">noise</a>, is its <em>distributivity
over addition</em>. We can illustrate this by <a href="pixadd.htm">adding</a> the
complex Fourier images of the two previous example images. To display
the result and emphasize the main peaks, we threshold the magnitude of
the complex image, as can be seen in 
</p><blockquote><a href="images/stp1fur4.gif"><img alt="stp1fur4" src="thumbs/stp1fur4.GIF" /></a></blockquote>
<p> Applying
the inverse Fourier Transform to the complex image yields

</p><blockquote><a href="images/stp1fil2.gif"><img alt="stp1fil2" src="thumbs/stp1fil2.GIF" /></a></blockquote>
<p> According to the distributivity law, this image
is the same as the direct sum of the two original spatial domain images.

</p><p>Finally, we present an example (<em>i.e.</em> text orientation finding) where
the Fourier Transform is used to gain information about the geometric
structure of the spatial domain image. Text recognition using image
processing techniques is simplified if we can assume that the text
lines are in a predefined direction. Here we show how the Fourier
Transform can be used to find the initial orientation of the text and
then a <a href="rotate.htm">rotation</a> can be applied to correct the error. We
illustrate this technique using 
</p><blockquote><a href="images/son3.gif"><img alt="son3" src="thumbs/son3.GIF" /></a></blockquote>
<p> a binary
image of English text. The logarithm of the magnitude of its Fourier
transform is 
</p><blockquote><a href="images/son3fur2.gif"><img alt="son3fur2" src="thumbs/son3fur2.GIF" /></a></blockquote>
<p> and 
</p><blockquote><a href="images/son3fur4.gif"><img alt="son3fur4" src="thumbs/son3fur4.GIF" /></a></blockquote>
<p> is
the thresholded magnitude of the Fourier image. We can see that the
main values lie on a vertical line, indicating that the text lines in
the input image are horizontal. <br /> If we proceed in the same way with

</p><blockquote><a href="images/son3rot1.gif"><img alt="son3rot1" src="thumbs/son3rot1.GIF" /></a></blockquote>
<p> which was rotated about 45°, we obtain

</p><blockquote><a href="images/son3fur1.gif"><img alt="son3fur1" src="thumbs/son3fur1.GIF" /></a></blockquote>
<p> and 
</p><blockquote><a href="images/son3fur3.gif"><img alt="son3fur3" src="thumbs/son3fur3.GIF" /></a></blockquote>
<p> in the Fourier space. We
can see that the line of the main peaks in the Fourier domain is
rotated according to rotation of the input image. The second line in
the logarithmic image (perpendicular to the main direction) originates
from the black corners in the rotated image.

</p><p>Although we managed to find a threshold which separates the main peaks from the background, we have a reasonable amount of noise in the Fourier image resulting from the irregular pattern of the letters. We could decrease these background values and therefore increase the difference to the main peaks if we were able to form solid blocks out of the text-lines. This could, for example, be done by using a <a href="morops.htm">morphological operator</a>.

</p><p></p><h2>Common Variants</h2>

<p><a name="6"><img alt="" src="mote.gif" /></a>Another sinusoidal transform
(<em>i.e.</em> transform with sinusoidal base functions) related to the DFT is
the <em>Discrete Cosine Transform</em> (DCT). For an N×N image, the
DCT is given by 
</p><blockquote>
<img alt="Eqn:eqnfourd" src="eqns/eqnfourd.gif" align="bottom" />
</blockquote> 
with 
<blockquote>
<img alt="Eqn:eqnfoure" src="eqns/eqnfoure.gif" align="bottom" />
</blockquote>

<p><a name="7"><img alt="" src="mote.gif" /></a>The
main advantages of the DCT are that it yields a real valued output
image and that it is a fast transform. A major use of the DCT is in
image compression --- <em>i.e.</em> trying to reduce the amount of data needed
to store an image. After performing a DCT it is possible to throw away
the coefficients that encode high frequency components that the human
eye is not very sensitive to. Thus the amount of data can be reduced,
without seriously affecting the way an image looks to the human eye.
