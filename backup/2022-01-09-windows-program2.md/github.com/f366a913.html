## What is ReactOS?

ReactOS™ is an Open Source effort to develop a quality operating system that
is compatible with applications and drivers written for the Microsoft®
Windows™ NT family of operating systems (NT4, 2000, XP, 2003, Vista, 7).

The ReactOS project, although currently focused on Windows Server 2003
compatibility, is always keeping an eye toward compatibility with Windows
Vista and future Windows NT releases.

The code of ReactOS is licensed under [GNU GPL
2.0](https://github.com/reactos/reactos/blob/master/COPYING).

### Product quality warning

**ReactOS is currently an Alpha quality operating system.** This means that
ReactOS is under heavy development and you have to be ready to encounter some
problems. Different things may not work well and it can corrupt the data
present on your hard disk. It is HIGHLY recommended to test ReactOS on a
virtual machine or on a computer with no sensitive or critical data!

## Building

[![Build](https://github.com/reactos/reactos/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/reactos/reactos/workflows/Build/badge.svg)
[![rosbewin.badge](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/48eaf976ebb0bdb2bb42ee1606041cd2c31332bfc2a20b623820e83043d7b9bd/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f62616467652f526f7342455f57696e646f77732d322e322e302d3036383843422e737667)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/reactos/files/RosBE-

Unix/2.2/)
[![coverity.badge](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/94502fce055ca7b2d6874d405f122cd46ad3cf2ce3e4a9ca117994335a342937/68747470733a2f2f7363616e2e636f7665726974792e636f6d2f70726f6a656374732f3230352f62616467652e7376673f666c61743d31)](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/205)

To build the system it is strongly advised to use the _ReactOS Build
Environment (RosBE)._ Up-to-date versions for Windows and for Unix/GNU-Linux
are available from our download page at: ["Build
Environment"](https://reactos.org/wiki/Build_Environment).

Alternatively one can use Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) version 2015+. Building
with MSVC is covered here: ["Visual Studio or Microsoft Visual
C++"](https://reactos.org/wiki/CMake#Visual_Studio_or_Microsoft_Visual_C.2B.2B).

See ["Building ReactOS"](https://reactos.org/wiki/Building_ReactOS) article
for more details.

### Binaries

To build ReactOS you must run the `configure` script in the directory you want
to have your build files. Choose `configure.cmd` or `configure.sh` depending
on your system. Then run `ninja <modulename>` to build a module you want or
just `ninja` to build all modules.

### Bootable images

To build a bootable CD image run `ninja bootcd` from the build directory. This
will create a CD image with a filename `bootcd.iso`.

You can always download fresh binary builds of bootable images from the
["Daily builds"](https://reactos.org/getbuilds/) page.

## Installing

By default, ReactOS currently can only be installed on a machine that has a
FAT16 or FAT32 partition as the active (bootable) partition. The partition on
which ReactOS is to be installed (which may or may not be the bootable
partition) must also be formatted as FAT16 or FAT32. ReactOS Setup can format
the partitions if needed.

Starting with 0.4.10, ReactOS can be installed using the BtrFS file system.
But consider this as an experimental feature and thus regressions not
triggered on FAT setup may be observed.

To install ReactOS from the bootable CD distribution, extract the archive
contents. Then burn the CD image, boot from it, and follow the instructions.

See ["Installing ReactOS"](https://reactos.org/wiki/Installing_ReactOS) Wiki
page or [INSTALL](/reactos/reactos/blob/master/INSTALL) for more details.

## Testing

If you discover a bug in ReactOS search on JIRA first - it might be reported
already. If not report the bug providing logs and as much information as
possible.

See ["File Bugs"](https://reactos.org/wiki/File_Bugs) for a guide.

**NOTE:** The bug tracker is _not_ for discussions. Please use our [official
chat](https://chat.reactos.org/) or our [forum](https://reactos.org/forum/).

## More information

ReactOS is a Free and Open Source operating system based on the Windows
architecture, providing support for existing applications and drivers, and an
alternative to the current dominant consumer operating system.

It is not another wrapper built on Linux, like WINE. It does not attempt or
plan to compete with WINE; in fact, the user-mode part of ReactOS is almost
entirely WINE-based and our two teams have cooperated closely in the past.

ReactOS is also not "yet another OS". It does not attempt to be a third player
like any other alternative OS out there. People are not meant to uninstall
Linux and use ReactOS instead; ReactOS is a replacement for Windows users who
want a Windows replacement that behaves just like Windows.

More information is available at: [reactos.org](https://reactos.org/).

Also see the [media/doc](/reactos/reactos/blob/master/media/doc) subdirectory
for some sparse notes.

## Who is responsible

Active devs are listed as members of [GitHub
organization](https://github.com/orgs/reactos/people). See also the
[CREDITS](/reactos/reactos/blob/master/CREDITS) file for others.

## Code mirrors

The main development is done on [GitHub](https://github.com/reactos/reactos).
We have an [alternative mirror](https://git.reactos.org/?p=reactos.git) in
case GitHub is down.

There is also an obsolete [SVN archive
repository](https://svn.reactos.org/reactos/) that is kept for historical
purposes.
