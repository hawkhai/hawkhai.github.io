(Deutsch: [MathJax: LaTeX Basic Tutorial und
Referenz](https://www.mathelounge.de/509545/mathjax-latex-basic-tutorial-und-
referenz-deutsch))

To see how any formula was written in any question or answer, including this
one, right-click on the expression and choose "Show Math As > TeX Commands".
(When you do this, the '$' will not display. Make sure you add these: see the
next point. There are also [other ways](/questions/659/how-to-view-latex-
source-of-equations) to view the code for the formula or the whole post.)

  1. **For inline formulas, enclose the formula in`$`…`$`. For displayed formulas, use `$$`…`$$`.**

    * These render differently. For example, type the following to show _inline_ mode:  
`$\sum_{i=0}^n i^2 = \frac{(n^2+n)(2n+1)}{6}$`  
∑ni=0i2=(n2+n)(2n+1)6∑ni=0i2=(n2+n)(2n+1)6

    * or type the following for display mode:  
`$$\sum_{i=0}^n i^2 = \frac{(n^2+n)(2n+1)}{6}$$`  
n∑i=0i2=(n2+n)(2n+1)6

∑i=0ni2=(n2+n)(2n+1)6

  2. For **Greek letters** , use `\alpha`, `\beta`, …, `\omega`: αα, ββ, …, ωω.

    * For uppercase letters, use `\Gamma`, `\Delta`, …, `\Omega`: ΓΓ, ΔΔ, …, ΩΩ.
    * For other Greek capital letters, use Latin `$A,`, `B`, `E$` and so on: A,B,EA,B,E.
    * Some Greek letters have variant forms: `\epsilon \varepsilon` ϵϵ, εε, `\phi \varphi` ϕϕ, φφ, and others.
  3. For **superscripts and subscripts** , use `^` and `_`. For example, `x_i^2`: x2ix2i, `\log_2 x`: log2xlog2x.

  4. **Groups**. Superscripts, subscripts, and other operations apply only to the next “group”. A “group” is either a single symbol, or any formula surrounded by curly braces `{`…`}`.

    * If you do `10^10`, you will get a surprise: 10101010. But `10^{10}` gives what you probably wanted: 10101010.
    * Use curly braces to delimit a formula to which a superscript or subscript applies: `x^5^6` is an error; `{x^y}^z` is xyzxyz, and `x^{y^z}` is xyzxyz. Observe the differences between `x_i^2` x2ix2i, `x_{i^2}` xi2xi2 and `{x_i}^2` xi2xi2.
  5. **Parentheses** Ordinary symbols `()[]` make parentheses and brackets (2+3)[4+4](2+3)[4+4]. Use `\{` and `\}` for curly braces {}{}.

    * These do _not_ scale with the formula in between, so if you write `(\frac{\sqrt x}{y^3})` the parentheses will be too small: (√xy3)(x√y3). Using `\left(`…`\right)` will make the sizes adjust automatically to the formula they enclose: `\left(\frac{\sqrt x}{y^3}\right)` is (√xy3)(x√y3).

    * `\left` and`\right` apply to all the following sorts of parentheses: `(` and `)` (x)(x), `[` and `]` [x][x], `\{` and `\}` {x}{x}, `|` |x||x|, `\vert` |x||x|, `\Vert` ‖x‖∥x∥, `\langle` and `\rangle` ⟨x⟩⟨x⟩, `\lceil` and `\rceil` ⌈x⌉⌈x⌉, and `\lfloor` and `\rfloor` ⌊x⌋⌊x⌋. `\middle` can be used to add additional dividers. There are also invisible parentheses, denoted by `.`: use `\left.x^2\right\rvert_3^5 = 5^2-3^2` to get x2|53=52−32

x2∣∣53=52−32

  6. **Sums and integrals** `\sum` and `\int`; the subscript is the lower limit and the superscript is the upper limit, so for example `\sum_1^n` ∑n1∑n1. Don't forget `{`…`}` if the limits are more than a single symbol. For example, `\sum_{i=0}^\infty i^2` is ∑∞i=0i2∑∞i=0i2.

    * Similarly, `\prod` ∏∏, `\int` ∫∫, `\bigcup` ⋃⋃, `\bigcap` ⋂⋂, `\iint` ∬∬, `\iiint` ∭∭, `\idotsint` ∫⋯∫∫⋯∫.
  7. **Fractions** There are [three ways to make fractions](/questions/12978/should-dfrac-be-edited-in). `\frac ab` applies to the next two groups, and produces abab; for more complicated numerators and denominators use `{`…`}`: `\frac{a+1}{b+1}` is a+1b+1a+1b+1.

    * If the numerator and denominator are complicated, you may prefer `\over`, which splits up the group that it is in: `{a+1\over b+1}` is a+1b+1a+1b+1.
    * For continued fractions, [use `\cfrac` instead of `\frac`](/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference/5058#5058).
  8. **Fonts**

  * Use `\mathbb` or `\Bbb` for "blackboard bold": CHNQRZCHNQRZ.
  * Use `\mathbf` for boldface: CHNQRZCHNQRZ chnqrzchnqrz. 
    * For expression based characters, use `\boldsymbol` instead: α
  * Use `\mathit` for italics: CHNQRZ chnqrz.
  * Use `\pmb` for boldfaced italics: CHNQRZCHNQRZ chnqrzchnqrz.
  * Use `\mathtt` for "typewriter" font: CHNQRZ chnqrz.
  * Use `\mathrm` for roman font: CHNQRZ chnqrz.
  * Use `\mathsf` for sans-serif font: CHNQRZ chnqrz.
  * Use `\mathcal` for "calligraphic" letters: CHNQRZ (Uppercase only.)
  * Use `\mathscr` for script letters: CHNQRZ chnqrz
  * Use `\mathfrak` for "Fraktur" (old German style) letters: CHNQRZ chnqrz.

  9. **Radical signs / roots** Use `sqrt`, which adjusts to the size of its argument: `\sqrt{x^3}` √x3; `\sqrt[3]{\frac xy}` 3√xy. For complicated expressions, consider using `{...}^{1/2}` instead.

  10. Some **special functions** such as "lim", "sin", "max", "ln", and so on are normally set in roman font instead of italic font. Use `\lim`, `\sin`, etc. to make these: `\sin x` sinx, not `sin x` sinx. Use subscripts to attach a notation to `\lim`: `\lim_{x\to 0}` limx→0

Nonstandard function names can be set with `\operatorname{foo}(x)` foo(x).

  11. There are a very large number of **special symbols and notations** , too many to list here; see the short listing [LATEX and AMS-LATEX Symbols](https://pic.plover.com/MISC/symbols.pdf) prepared by Dr. Emre Sermutlu, or the exhaustive listing [The Comprehensive LATEX Symbol List](https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/symbols/comprehensive/symbols-a4.pdf) by Scott Pakin. Some of the most common include:

  * `\lt \gt \le \ge \neq` <, >, ≤, ≥,≠. You can use `\not` to put a slash through almost anything: `\not\lt` ≮ but it often looks bad.

  * `\times \div \pm \mp` ×, ÷, ±, ∓. `\cdot` is a centered dot: x⋅y

  * `\cup \cap \setminus \subset \subseteq \subsetneq \supset \in \notin \emptyset \varnothing` ∪, ∩, ∖, ⊂, ⊆, ⊊, ⊃, ∈, ∉, ∅, ∅

  * `{n+1 \choose 2k}` or `\binom{n+1}{2k}` (n+12k)

  * `\to \gets \rightarrow \leftarrow \Rightarrow \Leftarrow \mapsto \implies \iff` →, ←, →, ←, ⇒, ⇐, ↦, ⟹, ⟺

  * `\land \lor \lnot \forall \exists \top \bot \vdash \vDash` ∧, ∨, ¬, ∀, ∃, ⊤, ⊥, ⊢, ⊨

  * `\star \ast \oplus \circ \bullet` ⋆, ∗, ⊕, ∘, ∙

  * `\approx \sim \simeq \cong \equiv \prec \lhd` ≈, ∼, ≃, ≅, ≡, ≺, ⊲

  * `\infty \aleph_0` ∞ℵ0 `\nabla \partial` ∇, ∂ `\Im \Re` ℑ, ℜ

  * For modular equivalence, use `\pmod` like this: `a\equiv b\pmod n` a≡b(modn). For the binary mod operator, use `\bmod` like this: `a\bmod 17` amod17.

  * Use `\dots` for the triple dots in a1,a2,…,an and a1+a2+⋯+an

  * Script lowercase l is `\ell` ℓ.

[Detexify](https://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html) lets you draw a symbol
on a web page and then lists the TEX symbols that seem to resemble it. These
are not guaranteed to work in MathJax, but it's a good place to start. To
check that a command is supported, note that MathJax.org maintains a [list of
currently supported LATEX
commands](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/input/tex/macros/index.html), and
one can also check Dr. Carol JVF Burns's page of [TEX Commands Available in
MathJax](https://www.onemathematicalcat.org/MathJaxDocumentation/TeXSyntax.htm).

  12. **Spaces** MathJax usually decides for itself how to space formulas, using a complex set of rules. Putting extra literal spaces into formulas will not change the amount of space MathJax puts in: `a␣b` and `a␣␣␣␣b` are both ab. To add more space, use `\,` for a thin space ab; `\;` for a wider space ab. `\quad` and `\qquad` are large spaces: ab, ab.

To set plain text, use `\text{…}`: {x∈s∣x is extra large}. You can nest `$…$`
inside of `\text{…}`, for example to access spaces.

  13. **Accents and diacritical marks** Use `\hat` for a single symbol ˆx, `\widehat` for a larger formula ^xy. If you make it too wide, it will look silly. Similarly, there are `\bar` ˉx and `\overline` ¯xyz, and `\vec` →x and `\overrightarrow` →xy and `\overleftrightarrow` ↔xy. For dots, as in ddxx˙x=˙x2+x¨x, use `\dot` and `\ddot`.

  14. Special characters used for MathJax interpreting can be escaped using the `\` character: \$ $, `\{` {, `\}` }, `\_` _, `\#` #, `\&` &. If you want `\` itself, you should use `\backslash` (symbol) or `\setminus` ([binary operation](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/511328/difference-between-commands-setminus-and-backslash/511332#511332)) for ∖, because `\\` is for a new line.

Some capital Greek letters are the same as the Roman equivalents, so they are
not separated in LATEX. For a capital beta, one must use something like
`\mathrm{B}`: B

A quick addition to point 11: If you want to use a sin-like symbol that is not
already defined, the command is `\operatorname`: e.g., `\operatorname{Spec} A`
gives SpecA.

It might be useful to mention hanging subscripts for things like `_5C_3` 5C3.
You could also mention `\frac` vs `\dfrac`.

My basic idea is that if a beginner can express a formula clearly, then
someone else can come in and clean up the typesetting afterwards. I am
considering getting rid of the section about `\big`, `\left`, and `\right` for
this reason, and trimming the section on spacing.

Most of the references to TeX or LaTeX in this and the answers ought to be to
MathJaX (the exception that I can see being the output of Detexify). I know
this is a bit pedantic, but would it be alright to correct this?

@MJD Okay, I've had a go (also the answer about arrays). I wonder also whether
or not it is worth a sentence at the end pointing out that whilst MathJaX does
its best to emulate TeX, it isn't TeX and so while knowing how something is
done in TeX gives you a starting point, it isn't a guarantee that the same
thing works in MathJaX. (As a case in point, questions about MathJaX are
generally _off-topic_ over on TeX-SX.)

@AndrewStacey I wouldn't. They are close enough that it seems to me to be a
needless refinement. I might even argue that MathJax _is_ TEX, although an
alternative implementation. We're willing to accept that other programming
languages (JavaScript, for example) that have slightly incompatible
implementations are nevertheless the same language; why not in this case as
well?

@MJD Except that this is meant as a tutorial for those who aren't familiar
with the distinction (and there really is a distinction: "slightly
incompatible implementations" doesn't really fit the bill here). One thing
tutorials often include is a "Where to find out more" section. This doesn't.
Someone who doesn't know the distinction might be tempted to search for help
on TeX or LaTeX instead and wonder why it doesn't work.

@AndrewStacey All the tips given here would work in any TEX/LATEX environment
with the proper packages. MathJax is just the service used to render it. You
wouldn't say "Miktex tutorial" or "texlive tutorial".

@axblount But that's precisely the wrong way around to think about it! The
likelihood is that someone will look at this tutorial to figure out how to
write something on the Maths-SX site: i.e., to use MathJaX. If they can't find
help here, where do they go? If they have the idea that MathJaX is "just a
javascript implementation of TeX" then they might think to look for help with
TeX, but that is quite possibly _not_ going to be helpful.

@axblount For a start, you've changed the goalposts: "LaTeX **math**
expressions". LaTeX is so much more than just a way of typesetting maths!
Second, I don't really know but it wouldn't take me long to cook one up. I
don't use MathJaX so I haven't explored it. But I know, for example, that it
can't handle catcode changes. Which means that I can't make `(` and `)`
_automatically_ resizeable. I can in LaTeX.

@MJD: I use `\mathrm` in many places; e.g. dx in integrals and derivatives and
for operator names that don't need the full force of `\operatorname`.
`\mathrm` was intended for roman symbols in math mode; `\text` was intended
for text because of the way it spaces things. See [this TEX
thread](http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/19502). Since I don't believe we can
use preambles in MathJax, we can't use `\DeclareMathOperator`, though we can
use `\newcommand`, but that is orthogonal to the use of `\mathrm` vs `\text`
for math symbols.

# Matrices

  1. Use `$$\begin{matrix}…\end{matrix}$$` In between the `\begin` and `\end`, put the matrix elements. End each matrix row with `\\`, and separate matrix elements with `&`. For example,
    
        $$
    \begin{matrix}
    1 & x & x^2 \\
    1 & y & y^2 \\
    1 & z & z^2 \\
    \end{matrix}
    $$
    

produces:

1xx21yy21zz2

MathJax will adjust the sizes of the rows and columns so that everything fits.

  2. To add brackets, either use `\left…\right` as in section 6 of the tutorial, or replace `matrix` with `pmatrix` (1234), `bmatrix` [1234], `Bmatrix` {1234}, `vmatrix` |1234|, `Vmatrix` ‖1234‖.

  3. Use `\cdots` ⋯ `\ddots` ⋱ `\vdots` ⋮ when you want to omit some of the entries:

(1a1a21⋯an11a2a22⋯an2⋮⋮⋮⋱⋮1ama2m⋯anm)

  4. For horizontally "augmented" matrices, put parentheses or brackets around a suitably-formatted table; see [arrays](http://meta.math.stackexchange.com/a/5044/) below for details. Here is an example:

[123456]

is produced by:

    
    
        $$ \left[
    \begin{array}{cc|c}
      1&2&3\\
      4&5&6
    \end{array}
    \right] $$
    

The `cc|c` is the crucial part here; it says that there are three centered
columns with a vertical bar between the second and third.

  5. For vertically "augmented" matrices, use `\hline`. For example

(abcd1001)

is produced by

    
    
    $$
      \begin{pmatrix}
        a & b\\
        c & d\\
      \hline
        1 & 0\\
        0 & 1
      \end{pmatrix}
    $$
    

  6. For small inline matrices use `\bigl(\begin{smallmatrix} ... \end{smallmatrix}\bigr)`, e.g. (abcd) is produced by:
    
          $\bigl( \begin{smallmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{smallmatrix} \bigr)$

## Symbols

In general, you have to search in long tables about a specific symbol you're
looking for, things like Ψ, δ, ζ, ≥, ⊆ ... And it turns out that this
operation can be frustrating and time consuming, which can cause the buddy to
abandon writing the complete LATEX sentence in his answer, or in some cases,
the complete answer itself.

That's why the tool that I will present you in this post was conceived.
Basically, it is a LATEX _handwritten symbol recognition_. Example in image:

![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ScK3R.png)

Here is the website: [Detexify²](http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html)
No more frustration.

# Aligned equations

Often people want a series of equations where the equals signs are aligned. To
get this, use `\begin{align}…\end{align}`. Each line should end with `\\`, and
should contain an ampersand at the point to align at, typically immediately
before the equals sign.

For example,

√37=√732−1122=√732122⋅732−1732=√732122√732−1732=7312√1−1732≈7312(1−12⋅732)

is produced by

    
    
    \begin{align}
    \sqrt{37} & = \sqrt{\frac{73^2-1}{12^2}} \\
     & = \sqrt{\frac{73^2}{12^2}\cdot\frac{73^2-1}{73^2}} \\ 
     & = \sqrt{\frac{73^2}{12^2}}\sqrt{\frac{73^2-1}{73^2}} \\
     & = \frac{73}{12}\sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{73^2}} \\ 
     & \approx \frac{73}{12}\left(1 - \frac{1}{2\cdot73^2}\right)
    \end{align}
    

The usual `$$` marks that delimit the display may be omitted here.

The AMS's [Short Math Guide](ftp://ftp.ams.org/pub/tex/doc/amsmath/short-math-

I sometimes find that one line of this environment is too close to another,
making them uncomfortable to read. The interline spacing can be adjusted by
using input such as `\\[1ex]` instead of `\\ `. (And of course the `1` can be
changed to another value such as `1.5` or `.7` in order to get enough space
but not too much.)

## Definitions by cases (piecewise functions)

Use `\begin{cases}…\end{cases}`. End each case with a `\\`, and use `&` before
parts that should be aligned.

For example, you get this:

f(n)={n/2,if n is even3n+1,if n is odd

by writing this:

    
    
      f(n) =
    \begin{cases}
    n/2,  & \text{if $n$ is even} \\
    3n+1, & \text{if $n$ is odd}
    \end{cases}
    

The brace can be moved to the right: if n is even:n/2if n is odd:3n+1}=f(n)

by writing this:

    
    
    \left.
    \begin{array}{l}
    \text{if $n$ is even:}&n/2\\
    \text{if $n$ is odd:}&3n+1
    \end{array}
    \right\}
    =f(n)
    

To get a larger vertical space between cases we can use `\\[2ex]` instead of
`\\`. For example, you get this:

f(n)={n2,if n is even3n+1,if n is odd

by writing this:

    
    
    f(n) =
    \begin{cases}
    \frac{n}{2},  & \text{if $n$ is even} \\[2ex]
    3n+1, & \text{if $n$ is odd}
    \end{cases}
    

(An ‘ex’ is a length equal to the height of the letter `x`; `2ex` here means
the space should be two exes high.)

## Arrays

It is often easier to read tables formatted in MathJax rather than plain text
or a fixed width font. Arrays and tables are created with the `array`
environment. Just after `\begin{array}` the format of each column should be
listed, use `c` for a center aligned column, `r` for right aligned, `l` for
left aligned and a `|` for a vertical line. Just as with matrices, cells are
separated with `&` and rows are broken using `\\`. A horizontal line spanning
the array can be placed before the current line with `\hline`.

For example, nLeftCenterRight10.2411252−1189−83−2020001+10i

    
    
    $$
    \begin{array}{c|lcr}
    n & \text{Left} & \text{Center} & \text{Right} \\
    \hline
    1 & 0.24 & 1 & 125 \\
    2 & -1 & 189 & -8 \\
    3 & -20 & 2000 & 1+10i
    \end{array}
    $$
    

Arrays can be nested to make an array of tables.

For example,
min012300000101112012230123max012300123111232222333333Δ012300123110122210133210

As the source for the preceding array is long, please right-click on one of
the tables and choose Show Math As ▸ TeX Commands.

  * @exploringnet: on my keyboard, it is the shifted backslash. It may be in different places (or absent) depending on your keyboard. On my mobile device (iPhone), it is in the shifted numerics, to the right of the backslash. In mathmode, `\vert` gives | and `\mid` gives ∣, but neither works in the column spec for an array. If you cannot type it on your keyboard, you can alwaays copy and paste it from another document.

  * @Rahul: why did regulars not press developers to enhance HTML formatting instead of doing inconvenient and resource-devouring detours through MathJax? When a table contains (mostly) formulæ, the use of a formula-formatting engine looks determined. But when one wants _just a table,_ why should it run software with completely different purpose? I once tried to speak about it at meta.SE, but was gagged.

## Fussy spacing issues

These are issues that won't affect the correctness of formulas, but might make
them look significantly better or worse. Beginners should feel free to ignore
this advice; someone else will correct it for them, or more likely nobody will
care.

Don't use `\frac` in exponents or limits of integrals; it looks bad and can be
confusing, which is why it is rarely done in professional mathematical
typesetting. Write the fraction horizontally, with a slash:

BadBettereiπ2eiπ2eiπ/2∫π2−π2sinxdx∫π/2−π/2sinxdx

The `|` symbol has the wrong spacing when it is used as a divider, for example
in set comprehensions. Use `\mid` instead:

BadBetter{x|x2∈Z}{x∣x2∈Z}

When using stretchable delimiters (i.e. with `\left` and `\right`), it may be
preferable to use `\,\middle|\,`. This produces a stretchable vertical bar
with a little bit of space around it. Another alternative is to use a colon
instead.

BadBetter{mn∣m,n∈Z}{mn|m,n∈Z}

For double and triple integrals, don't use `\int\int` or `\int\int\int`.
Instead use the special forms `\iint` and `\iiint`:
BadBetter∫∫Sf(x)dydx∬Sf(x)dydx∫∫∫Vf(x)dzdydx∭Vf(x)dzdydx

Use `\,` to insert a thin space before differentials; without this TEX will
mash them together:

BadBetter∭Vf(x)dzdydx∭Vf(x)dzdydx

I think the first adjusted fraction looks better than the original, but I
don't like the second. In any case, this minor spacing imbalance is too
peripheral to belong in a basic MathJax tutorial IMO. Too likely to scare
people away rather than make them feel helped.

# Crossing things out

Use `\require{cancel}` in the first formula in your post that requires
cancelling; you need it only once per page. Then use:

y+\cancel{x}y+x\cancel{y+x}y+xy+\bcancel{x}y+xy+\xcancel{x}y+xy+\cancelto{0}{x}y+x0\frac{1\cancel9}{\cancel95}
= \frac151995=15

Use `\require{enclose}` for the following:

\enclose{horizontalstrike}{x+y}x+y\enclose{verticalstrike}{\frac
xy}xy\enclose{updiagonalstrike}{x+y}x+y\enclose{downdiagonalstrike}{x+y}x+y\enclose{horizontalstrike,updiagonalstrike}{x+y}x+y

`\enclose` can also produce enclosing boxes, circles, and other notations; see
[MathML `menclose` documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-
US/docs/Web/MathML/Element/menclose) for a complete list.

It is worth noting that MathJax should _not_ be used for formatting non-
mathematical text. The preferred way for striking out text is to use the HTML
strikethrough tag, `<s>[text to be striken]</s>`, which renders as ~~[text to
be striken]~~.

## Additional decorations

`\overline`: ¯A ¯AA ¯AAA

`\underline`: B_ BB_ BBB_

`\widetilde`: ˜C ~CC ~CCC

`\widehat`: ˆD ^DD ^DDD

`\fbox`: E EE EEE

`\underleftarrow`: F← FF← FFF← variant: `\xleftarrow{}`: abc←

`\underrightarrow`: G→ GG→ GGG→ variant: `\xrightarrow{}`: abc→

`\underleftrightarrow`: H↔ HH↔ HHH↔

`\overrightarrow` →AB →ABAB →ABABAB

`\overbrace`: ⏞(n−2)+(n−1)+(n+0)+(n+1)+(n+2)

`\underbrace`: (n−2)+(n−1)+(n+0)+(n+1)+(n+2)⏟

`\underbrace`: underbraces can be nested, like this:
(n−2)+(n−1)+(n+0)⏟+(n+1)⏟+(n+2)⏟

`\overbrace` and `\underbrace` accept a superscript or a subscript,
respectively, to annotate the brace. For example, `\underbrace{a\cdot a\cdots
a}_{b\text{ times}}` is a⋅a⋯a⏟b times

Note: `\varliminf`: lim_ and `\varlimsup`:¯lim have special symbol of their
own.

## Single character accents

`\check`: ˇI

`\acute`: ˊJ

`\grave`: ˊK

`\vec`: →u →AB (c.f. `\overrightarrow` above)

`\bar`: ˉz

`\hat`: ˆx

`\tilde`: ˜x

`\dot \ddot \dddot`: ˙x,¨x,⃛x

`\mathring`: ˚A

## General stacking

If you cannot find your symbol remember that you can stack various symbols
using

`\overset{above}{level}`: @ABC x2⟼ ∙∘∘∙T

`\underset{below}{level}`: ABC@ ⟼x2 T∙∘∘∙

You can use these together too. You can type Xa→bY with
`X\overset{a}{\underset{b}{\to}}Y`.

## Arc over points

`\overset{ \huge\frown}{PQ}`: ⌢PQ denotes the arc over points P and Q (As per
comment of @Calvin Khor to @Paul Sinclair's question)

## System of equations

  * Use `\begin{array}…\end{array}` and `\left\{…\right.`. For example, you get this:

{a1x+b1y+c1z=d1a2x+b2y+c2z=d2a3x+b3y+c3z=d3

by writing this:

    
    
    $$
    \left\{ 
    \begin{array}{c}
    a_1x+b_1y+c_1z=d_1 \\ 
    a_2x+b_2y+c_2z=d_2 \\ 
    a_3x+b_3y+c_3z=d_3
    \end{array}
    \right. 
    $$
    

  * Alternatively we can use `\begin{cases}…\end{cases}`. The same system

{a1x+b1y+c1z=d1a2x+b2y+c2z=d2a3x+b3y+c3z=d3

is produced by the following code

    
    
    $$\begin{cases}
    a_1x+b_1y+c_1z=d_1 \\ 
    a_2x+b_2y+c_2z=d_2 \\ 
    a_3x+b_3y+c_3z=d_3
    \end{cases}
    $$
    

  * To align the `=` signs use `\begin{aligned}...\end{aligned}` and `\left\{…\right.` (see asmeurer's comment) {a1x+b1y+c1z=d1+e1a2x+b2y=d2a3x+b3y+c3z=d3

whose code is

    
    
    $$
    \left\{
    \begin{aligned} 
    a_1x+b_1y+c_1z &=d_1+e_1 \\ 
    a_2x+b_2y&=d_2 \\ 
    a_3x+b_3y+c_3z &=d_3 
    \end{aligned} 
    \right. 
    $$
    

  * To align the `=` signs and the terms as in {a1x+b1y+c1z=d1+e1a2x+b2y=d2a3x+b3y+c3z=d3

use `array` with `l` (for "align **left** "; there are also `c` and `r`)
parameters

    
    
    $$
    \left\{
    \begin{array}{ll}
    a_1x+b_1y+c_1z &=d_1+e_1 \\ 
    a_2x+b_2y &=d_2 \\ 
    a_3x+b_3y+c_3z &=d_3 
    \end{array} 
    \right.
    $$
    

  * Vertical space between equations. As explained in [Definition by cases](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/a/5025/752) _to get a larger vertical space between_ equations _we can use_ `\\[2ex]` _instead of_ `\\`. The system

{a1x+b1y+c1z=p1q1a2x+b2y+c2z=p2q2a3x+b3y+c3z=p3q3

is generated by the following code

`$$\begin{cases} a_1x+b_1y+c_1z=d_1 \\[2ex] a_2x+b_2y+c_2z=d_2 \\[2ex]
a_3x+b_3y+c_3z=d_3 \end{cases} $$`

in comparison with

{a1x+b1y+c1z=p1q1a2x+b2y+c2z=p2q2a3x+b3y+c3z=p3q3

whose code is

`$$\begin{cases} a_1x+b_1y+c_1z=\frac{p_1}{q_1} \\
a_2x+b_2y+c_2z=\frac{p_2}{q_2} \\ a_3x+b_3y+c_3z=\frac{p_3}{q_3} \end{cases}

  * In response to [elect's comment](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference/6267#comment79746_6267). The following code

`$$ \left\{ \begin{array}{l} 0 = c_x-a_{x0}-d_{x0}\dfrac{(c_x-a_{x0})\cdot

## Commutative diagrams

(For more examples, see [this meta
question](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2324/).)

AMScd diagrams must start with a "require":

    
    
    $\require{AMScd}$
    \begin{CD}
    A @>a>> B\\
    @V b V V= @VV c V\\
    C @>>d> D
    \end{CD}
    

to get this diagram:  Aa→Bb↓=↓cC→dD

`@>>>` is used for arrow right

`@<<<` is used for arrow left

`@VVV` is used for arrow down

`@AAA` is used for arrow up

`@=` is used for horizontal double line

`@|` is used for vertical double line

`@.` is used for no arrow

Another example:

    
    
        \begin{CD}
        A @>>> B @>{\text{very long label}}>> C \\
        @. @AAA @| \\
        D @= E @<<< F
    \end{CD}
    

A→Bvery long label→C↑∥D=E←F

Long labels increase the length of the arrow and in this version also
automatically increase corresponding arrows.

    
    
    $\require{AMScd}$
    \begin{CD}
      RCOHR'SO_3Na @>{\text{Hydrolysis,$\Delta, Dil.HCl$}}>> (RCOR')+NaCl+SO_2+ H_2O 
    \end{CD}
    

RCOHR'SO3NaHydrolysis, Δ, Dil. HCl→(RCOR')+NaCl+SO2\+ H2O

## Colors

Named colors are browser-dependent; if a browser doesn't know a particular
color name, it may render the text as black. The following colors are standard
in HTML4 and CSS2 and should be interpreted the same by most browsers:
\color{black}{text}text\color{gray}{text}text\color{silver}{text}text\color{white}{text}text\color{maroon}{text}text\color{red}{text}text\color{yellow}{text}text\color{lime}{text}text\color{olive}{text}text\color{green}{text}text\color{teal}{text}text\color{aqua}{text}text\color{blue}{text}text\color{navy}{text}text\color{purple}{text}text\color{fuchsia}{text}text

HTML5 and [CSS 3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#CSS_3)
define [an additional 124 color names that will be supported on many
browsers](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/#svg-color).

Math Stack Exchange's default style uses a light-colored page background, so
avoid using light colors for text. Stick to darker colors like maroon, green,
blue, and purple, and remember also that 7–10% of men are color-blind and have
difficulty distinguishing red and green. (Some people have difficulty
distinguishing other colors too, so don't rely on colors saying "the blue
part" over and over again.)

The color may also have the form `#rgb` where r,g,b are in the range or
`0`–`9`, `a`–`f` and represent the intensity of red, green, and blue on a
scale of 0–15, with `a`=10, `b`=11, … `f`=15. For example:

#000text#00Ftext#0F0text#0FFtext#F00text#F0Ftext#FF0text#FFFtext

#000text#005text#00Atext#00Ftext#500text#505text#50Atext#50Ftext#A00text#A05text#A0Atext#A0Ftext#F00text#F05text#F0Atext#F0Ftext#080text#085text#08Atext#08Ftext#580text#585text#58Atext#58Ftext#A80text#A85text#A8Atext#A8Ftext#F80text#F85text#F8Atext#F8Ftext#0F0text#0F5text#0FAtext#0FFtext#5F0text#5F5text#5FAtext#5FFtext#AF0text#AF5text#AFAtext#AFFtext#FF0text#FF5text#FFAtext#FFFtext

You can have a look [here for quick reference on colors in
HTML](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_colors.asp).

We should add that colors can be used on items other than text, such as
variables and operators. The '\color' command applies to the next item:
surround anything longer with braces.

One can in fact use any CSS-compatible colour specification here, including
`rgb`, `rgba`, `hsl`, and `hsla` colours. (I'd edit the answer, but have no
time now. Maybe later, if nobody else beats me to it.)

## Continued fractions

To make a continued fraction, use `\cfrac`, which works just like `\frac` but
typesets the results differently:

x=a0+12a1+22a2+32a3+44a4+⋯

Don't use regular `\frac` or `\over`, or it will look awful:

x=a0+12a1+22a2+32a3+44a4+⋯

You can of course use `\frac` for the compact notation:

x=a0+12a1+22a2+32a3+44a4+⋯

Continued fractions are too big to put inline. Display them with `$$`…`$$` or
use a notation like [a0;a1,a2,a3,…].

The RHS of the following continued fraction a1b1+a2b2+a3b3+⋱=a1b1+a2b2+a3b3+…

can be typeset with the \genfrac command '{\genfrac{}{}{}{}{a_1}{b_1}}
{\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{}{+}} {\genfrac{}{}{}{}{a_2}{b_2}}
{\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{}{+}} {\genfrac{}{}{}{}{a_3}{b_3}}

Yes, it is. I didn't mention it because in _User’s Guide for the amsmath
Package_ it is written the following: "Note. For technical reasons, using the
primitive fraction commands \over, \atop, \above in a LATEX document is not
recommended (see, e.g., amsmath.faq)."

# Tags & References

For longer calculations (or referring to other post's results) it is
convenient to use the tagging/labelling/referencing system. To tag an equation
use `\tag{yourtag}`, and if you want to refer to that tag later on, add
`\label{somelabel}` right after the `\tag`. It is not necessary that `yourtag`
and `somelabel` are the same, but it usually is more convenient to do so:

    
    
    $$ a := x^2-y^3 \tag{*}\label{*} $$
    

a:=x2−y3

In order to refer to an equation, just use `\eqref{somelabel}`

    
    
    $$ a+y^3 \stackrel{\eqref{*}}= x^2 $$
    

a+y3(*)=x2

or `\ref{somelabel}`

    
    
    Equations are usually referred to as $\eqref{*}$, but you can also use $\ref{*}$.
    

Equations are usually referred to as (*), but you can also use *.

As you can see, references are even turned into hyperlinks, which you can use
externally as well, e.g. [like
this](https://math.stackexchange.com/q/537284/#mjx-eqn-e). Note that you can
also reference labels in other posts as long as they appear on the same site,
which is especially useful when referring to a question with multiple
equations, or when commenting on a post.

* * *

~~Due to a[bug blocks containing a `\label` will break in
preview](http://meta.math.stackexchange.com/q/11392/163), as [a workaround you
can put `$\def\label#1{}$` in your post while editing and remove that on
submission](http://meta.math.stackexchange.com/questions/11392/mathjax-
preview-broken-when-equations-contain-labels#comment43134_11392) \-
unfortunately this means you won't spot misspelled references before
submitting... **Just don't forget to remove that`\def` again**~~

# Using `\newcommand`

I would like to remark that it is possible to define LaTeX commands as you do
in your TeX files. I felt so happy when I first discovered it! It's enough to
insert something like

    
    
    $ \newcommand{\SES}[3]{ 0 \to #1 \to #2 \to #3 \to 0 } $
    

at the top of your post (remember the dollars!). Then you can just use your
commands as you are used to do: in my example typing `$$ \SES{A}{B}{C} $$`
will produce the following:

0→A→B→C→0

It's also possible to use plain `\def`:

    
    
    \def\ses#1#2#3{0 \to #1 \to #2 \to #3 \to 0}
    

and then `$\ses{A}{B}{C}$` will produce the same output.

implies looks nicer as the arrow is longer and \to is quicker to right (and
it's also what you say in your head while typing it). at least that's what I
think.

Remember the difference between `\to` and `\mapsto` as in T:R→R,x↦x+1 produced
by `T:\mathbb R\to \mathbb R,\; x\mapsto x+1`

I prefer using `\to` when it appears as part of a larger propositional
formula, rather than at the top level, i.e. p∧((q∨r)→s), because the spacing
is similar to that of other binary operators. `\implies` is better for
sentence- or clause-level implications, or in displays, i.e. x+2=4−x⟹x=1.

  * I have always used _\Longleftarrow_ for _\impliedby_. It generates the same thing anyway, for which the former generates ⟸ and the latter generates ⟸ with _\Leftarrow_ ⇐ as an alternate for reverse implication.

# Big braces

Use `\left` and `\right` to make braces - (round), [square] and {curly} -
scale up to be the size of their arguments. Thus

    
    
    $$
    f\left(
       \left[ 
         \frac{
           1+\left\{x,y\right\}
         }{
           \left(
              \frac{x}{y}+\frac{y}{x}
           \right)
           \left(u+1\right)
         }+a
       \right]^{3/2}
    \right)
    $$
    

renders as f([1+{x,y}(xy+yx)(u+1)+a]3/2).

Note that curly braces need to be escaped as `\{ \}`.

If you start a big brace with `\left` and then need to match that to a
`\right` brace that's on a different line, use the forms `\right.` and
`\left.` to make "shadow" braces. Thus,

    
    
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    a=&\left(1+2+3+  \cdots \right. \\
    & \cdots+ \left. \infty-2+\infty-1+\infty\right)
    \end{aligned}
    $$
    

renders as a=(1+2+3+⋯⋯+∞−2+∞−1+∞).

There is also a `\middle` construct which is useful when one has a mid-
expression brace which must also scale up:

    
    
    $$
    \left\langle  
      q
    \middle\|
      \frac{\frac{x}{y}}{\frac{u}{v}}
    \middle| 
       p 
    \right\rangle
    $$
    

renders as ⟨q‖xyuv|p⟩.

Note that constructs like `\left\langle`, `\left|` and `\left\|` are also
possible.

Note: `\Big( ... \Big)` produces (…) but this bracket size is fixed in all
situations unlike `\left( ... \right)` which varies in size with its contents.
`\Big` can be useful in various situations.

## Limits

To make a limit (like limx→1x2−1x−1), use this syntax:  
  
First, start off with `$\lim`. This renders as lim. The backslash is there to
prevent things like lim, where the letters are slanted.  
  
Second, add `\limits_{x \to 1}` inside. The code now looks like `$\lim
\limits_{x \to 1}$`, and renders as limx→1. The `\to` inside makes the right
arrow, rendered as →. The `_` makes the x→1 go underneath the lim. Finally,
the pair of curly braces `{ }` makes sure that x→1 is treated as a whole
object, and not two separate things.  
  
Lastly, add the function you want to apply the limit to. To make the limit
mentioned above, limx→1x2−1x−1, simply use `$\lim\limits_{x \to 1}
\frac{x^2-1}{x-1}$`.  
  
And that is how you make a limit using MathJax.

Why not just `\lim_{x\to 1}` limx→1?

As I understand it `\limits` is only needed for operations that don't already
understand limits, for example if you want to use `+` and get k+i=1 instead of
+ki=1

When used inline, your suggestion will produce limx→1 instead of the more
compact form limx→1 that mathjax normally chooses. Are you sure this is good
advice?

– [MJD](/users/25554/mjd "64,093 reputation")

Feb 26, 2014 at 14:10

  * 4

@MJD `$\lim_{x\to 1}` renders to limx→1, and `$\lim\limits_{x\to 1` renders as
lim\limits_{x\to 1}. Note how the x→1 is separated from the first limit, and
not directly underneath. We do not write limits like that in real life, so we
use `\limits`.

Limits are usually written that way in typeset materials like papers and books
when the limit is inline, rather than a displayed formula, and that's why
MathJax typesets it that way.

The issue with this answer is that it is trying to "force" display mode on
inline code. Doing so makes the text look less pretty. For example, see how
the spacing between the lines change when I force display mode using
`\lim\limits_{x\mapsto 1}\dfrac1x`: limx↦11x. On the other hand, when I let
TEX do what it wants to do, using `\lim_{x\mapsto 1}\frac1x`, the spacing
between the lines stays the same, which is much neater: limx↦11x. This is much
easier on the eyes. If you want to make your math mode more prominent then
take a new line using `$$-$$`

# Arbitrary operators

If an operator is not available as a built-in command, use `\operatorname{…}`.
So for things like arsinh(x)

write `\operatorname{arsinh}(x)` since `\arsinh(x)` will give an error and
`arsinh(x)` has wrong font and spacing: arsinh(x).

This was already mentioned in [a
comment](http://meta.math.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-
tutorial-and-quick-reference/11638#comment19884_5020) by [Charles
Staats](http://meta.math.stackexchange.com/users/455/charles-staats). You
might consider this an addition to the FAQ section on `\lim`, `\sin` and so
on.

For operators which need limits above and below the operator, use
`\operatorname*{…}`, as in Resz=1(1z2−z)=1

New operators may also be defined using the `\DeclareMathOperator` syntax:
`\DeclareMathOperator{newOperatorCommand}{newOperator}` defines a new
operator. On the page where this code occurs, `\newOperatorCommand` will be
rendered as newOperator.

We can also use {\rm ...}. For example, {\rm arsinh} yields arsinh.

@Felix: `\rm` will change the font but not the spacing.
`\operatorname{arsinh}x` renders as “arsinhx” while `{\rm arsinh}x` renders as
“arsinhx”. Notice the added space between operator and operand in the first
example, which is missing in the second. On the whole, I'd say that
`operatorname` is a lot more in the spirit of semantic markup, declaring
_what_ you want to write instead of _how_ you want to write it, so I'd
strongly suggest using this.

Thanks for this. I thought carefully about whether to put `\operatorname` in
the main post, and decided to leave it out. The reason is simple: If a
beginner omits `\operatorname`, the resulting formula will still be perfectly
clear, and a more experienced user will have no trouble inserting the
`\operatorname` where it is needed. So including it in the main post would not
be a good use of space.

# Highlighting equation

To highlight an equation, `\bbox` can be used. E.g,

    
    
    $$ \bbox[yellow]
    {
    e^x=\lim_{n\to\infty} \left( 1+\frac{x}{n} \right)^n
    \qquad (1)
    }
    $$
    

produces

ex=limn→∞(1+xn)n(1)

By default, the bounding box is "tight", so it doesn't extend beyond the
characters used in the formula. You can add a little space around the equation
by adding a measurement after the color. E.g.,

    
    
    $$ \bbox[yellow,5px]
    {
    e^x=\lim_{n\to\infty} \left( 1+\frac{x}{n} \right)^n
    \qquad (1)
    }
    $$
    

produces

ex=limn→∞(1+xn)n(1)

To add a border, use

    
    
    $$ \bbox[5px,border:2px solid red]
    {
    e^x=\lim_{n\to\infty} \left( 1+\frac{x}{n} \right)^n
    \qquad (2) 
    }
    $$
    

produces

ex=limn→∞(1+xn)n(2)

You can do both border and background, as well:

    
    
    $$ \bbox[yellow,5px,border:2px solid red]
    {
    e^x=\lim_{n\to\infty} \left( 1+\frac{x}{n} \right)^n
    \qquad (1)
    }
    $$
    

produces

ex=limn→∞(1+xn)n(1)

# Absolute values and norms

The absolute value of some expression can be denoted as `\lvert x\rvert` or,
more generally, as `\left\lvert … \right\rvert`. It renders as |x|.

The norm of a vector (or similar) can be denoted as `\lVert v\rVert` or, more
generally, as `\left\lVert … \right\rVert`. It renders as ‖v‖. (You may also
write `\left\|…\right\|` instead.)

In both cases, the rendering is better than what you'd get from `|x|` or
`||v||`, which render with bars that don't descend low enough and sub-optimal
spacing. At least on some browsers, so here is a screenshot how it looks for
me, using Firefox 31 on OS X:

![Screenshot](https://i.stack.imgur.com/6midR.png)

And here is the same formula rendered by your browser:

|x|,||v||⟶|x|,‖v‖

It was typeset as

    
    
    $$|x|, ||v|| \quad\longrightarrow\quad \lvert x\rvert, \lVert v\rVert$$

You can use `\|x\|` instead of `\lVert x \rVert`; ‖x‖ and ‖x‖. (I don't think

The difference in output that you are seeing has to do with whether you have
the STIX fonts installed locally on your computer or not. The `|` in STIX
doesn't descend below the baseline, while in the MathJax TeX fonts it does.

@SomeGuy First, this is what `\tag` is meant for. It puts the (1) exactly
where it should be, at the right margin. Second, if you have an equation like
`0 = ax^2+bx+c` and you **just** use `(1)` on it instead of `\tag1`, you end
up with 0=ax2+bx+c(1). To fix this, instead of `\tag` you have to insert other
commands to make enough blank space. Not a net gain, in my opinion.

[this](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/9641/filled-diamondsuit-and-

@AlwaysConfused Unicode has those characters, so you can enter them however
you normally enter Unicode characters, or you can now use copy-paste to copy
them from this answer.

@MJD Not sure that your edit is a good idea, firstly because I think we would
prefer questions and answers on MSE to be in MathJax as far as possible,
secondly because this page is specifically a MathJax tutorial. However I'm not
really bothered - if you still think it's a good idea, let me know and I'll
approve the edit.

  * To the above commenters - it is possible, for instance ♥♡

achieved via the code `$$\color{yellow}♥\!\!\!\color{blue}♡$$ ` but you will
need to fiddle with the number of `\!`s depending on where you put it, because
I don't think there is a command in mathJax to place characters on top of each
other. Another example,`$$\Huge \color{green}\Huge
\color{green}♥\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\,\color{red}♡$$` gives ♥♡

## Left and Right Implication Arrows

Another way to display the arrows for right and left implication instead of
using

`$\Rightarrow$`, `$\Leftarrow$` and `$\Leftrightarrow$`

which produces ⇒, ⇐ and ⇔ respectively, you can use

`$\implies$` for ⟹, `$\impliedby$` for ⟸ and `$\iff$` for ⟺

The latter of which produces longer arrows which may be more desirable to
some.

# Degree symbol

Standard Mathjax does not yet support a dedicated degree symbol, so here are
some of the ways to try and emulate one :

45^\text{o}renders as45o45^orenders as45o45^\circrenders
as45∘45^{\large\circ}renders as45∘45\unicode{xB0}renders as45°Actual Unicode
character90°renders as90°Using keyboard entry of symbol

The degree symbol for angles is _not_ `^\circ`. Although many people use this
notation, the result looks quite different from the canonical [degree
symbol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_symbol) shipped with the font, as
seen above.

If your keyboard doesn't have a `°` key, feel free to copy from this post
here, or follow [these
suggestions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_symbol#Keyboard_entry).

_Note_ that comments below indicate that on some configurations at least, `°`
renders inferior to `^\circ`. And I recently had [a post of mine
edited](https://math.stackexchange.com/posts/612972/revisions#rev-
arrow-2c001335-10cd-45c9-a20f-6458a8020593) just for the sake of turning `°`
into `^\circ`, indicating that someone felt rather strongly about this. So the
suggestion above does seem somewhat controversial at the moment. I maintain
that from a semantic point of view, `°` is superior to `^\circ`, and if the
rendering suffers from this, then it's a bug in MathJax. After all, LaTeX
offers a proper degree symbol in the tex companion fonts, indicating that
someone there, too, decided that `^\circ` is not perfect. But if things are
broken now, I can't fault people from pragmatically sticking with the
rendering they prefer. Personally I prefer semantics, also for the sake of
screen readers.

**Accessibility**

Aside from appearance, one consideration in choosing which notation to use is
how it will get parsed by screen readers. For example,
[ChromeVox](http://www.chromevox.com/) reads both `45^\circ` and `45°` as
"forty-five degrees", while the other two are pronounced as "forty-five oh",
which may be a reason to avoid them.

**Usepackage**

Commonly in Latex you can `\usepackage{gensymb}` to get the `\degree` symbol,
however on Stack Exchange this is not an option. Note that even if you can do
this it will typically affect the entire page, which may have side effects for
other users. So don't rely on this approach.

If mathjax loads siunitx or gensymb, there is then \degree in latex which is
the degree symbol.

@dustin: I couldn't find siunitx or gensymb mentioned anywhere in the MatJax
source repository. Are they available as some kind of third-party extension?
If so, where? Since MathJax is _not_ LaTeX, packages can't be loaded unless
they have been migrated. By the way, all occurrences of “degree” in the
MathJax sources refer to something else, as far as I can tell, so there really
doesn't seem to be a `\degree` macro. There should be one, imho.

@Joffan: 167 is the decimal representation of the Codepoint for ° in Latin 1,
Unicode and CP-1252. Without the leading zero, CP-437 gets applied instead, at
least in typical English-speaking countries, so you'd use Alt+248 there. The
Wikipedia article I linked to already describes those two ways of entering the
symbol, and
[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt_code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt_code) has
some more details.

# Displaystyle and Textstyle

Many things like fractions, sums, limits, and integrals display differently
when written inline versus in a displayed formula. You can switch styles back
and forth with `\displaystyle` and `\textstyle` in order to achieve the
desired appearance.

Here's an example switching back and forth in a displayed equation:

>
>     $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} \to
>           \textstyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} \to
>           \displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2}$$
>  
>
> ∞∑n=11n2→∑∞n=11n2→∞∑n=11n2

It is possible to switch style inline as well:

>
>     Compare $\displaystyle \lim_{t \to 0} \int_t^1 f(t)\, dt$
>     versus $\lim_{t \to 0} \int_t^1 f(t)\, dt$.
>  
>
> Compare limt→0∫1tf(t)dt versus limt→0∫1tf(t)dt.

Do observe that the taller formulas gotten with `\displaystyle` distort the
line spacing.

> Filler text, more filler text and even more filler text, and an outrageous
> amount of filler text. It would not occur to me to use limt→0∫1tf(x)dx here.
> As we see, a formula typeset in displaystyle makes it necessary to move the
> lines further apart. A ridiculous amount of filler text to make a point. Not
> pleasing to the eye at all.

In other words, there is also a reason TeX defaults to `\textstyle` when
typesetting inline formulas.

# Vertical Spacing

Some formulas such as ¯a+¯b=¯a⋅b, √a−√b, do not look quite right when it comes
to vertical spacing. Fortunately, there is more than one way to fix this. One
can for instance employ the `\mathstrut` command as follows:

    
    
    $\sqrt{\mathstrut a} - \sqrt{\mathstrut b}$
    

Which yields: √(a−√(b. Or using `\vphantom` (vertical phantom) command, which
measures the height of its argument and places a math strut of that height
into the formula.

    
    
    $\sqrt{\vphantom{b} a} - \sqrt{b}$
    

Which renders as: √ba−√b.

Another issue is with the spacing within lines in situations like this,

> Based on the previous technique, we can simplify 1√ba−√b, and we thus get
> the result of the previous limit. [this text is added to show alignment with
> the above smashed object]

These two lines are too far apart, but this is unnecessary since the second
line is very short. We can solve this by using the `\smash` command, to get:

> Based on the previous technique, we can simplify 1√ba−√b, and we thus get
> the result of the previous limit. [this text is added to show alignment with
> the above smashed object]

**Beware** \- as above - the smashed text may overlap the next line if that
line extends far enough to reach the smashed object, so this solution is not
always feasible (it is esp. likely to occur in slim-width browsers, e.g.
phones). Analogous overlapping may occur with any prior lines. Note that smash
can be restricted to top or bottom with an argument: `\smash[t]...` or
`\smash[b]...`

– [dfeuer](/users/17596/dfeuer "8,929 reputation")

Mar 5, 2022 at 1:10

  * @dfeuer Android is not the source of the problem. Rather it is the fact that the browser window width is so short that the 2nd line extends far enough to be below the radical, so smashing the radical causes it to overlap the 2nd line. The same thing occurs in any browser if you make its width small enough.

Sep 5, 2022 at 19:42

  * @dfeuer Again, it's not "mobile" browsers that are the source of the problem - rather it is the fact that there is something displayed below the smashed object. That is more likely to occur on phones since they are more likely to have shorter width screens. If you shrink the width of a desktop browser window to be small enough (or extend the length of the following line) then the above answer will show the problem there too (e.g. I edited the answer to show that).

# Equation numbering

## Simple equation

To give an equation a number, use the `\tag{}`. To refer to it later, use
`\label{}` to label this equation. When you want to refer to it, use
`\eqref{}`. For example,

e=mc2

Equation (1) is one of the greatest equations in mankind's history. Equation
(1) is produced using the following code,

    
    
    $$e=mc^2 \tag{1}\label{eq1}$$
    

To refer to it, use `\eqref{eq1}`.

## Multi-line equation

Multi-line equation is actually just one equation rather than several
equations. So the correct environment is `aligned` instead of `align`.

a=b+c=d+e+f+g=h+i

Equation (2) is a multi-line equation. The code to produce equation (2) is

    
    
    $$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
    a &= b + c \\
      &= d + e + f + g \\
      &= h + i
    \end{aligned}\end{equation}\tag{2}\label{eq2}$$
    

## Multiple aligned equations

For multiple aligned equations, we use the `align` environment.

a=b+cx=yzl=m−n

Equation (3), (4) and (5) are multiple equations aligned together. The code to
produce these equations is,

    
    
    $$\begin{align}
    a &= b + c \tag{3}\label{eq3} \\
    x &= yz \tag{4}\label{eq4}\\
    l &= m - n \tag{5}\label{eq5}
    \end{align}$$

  * If there's an equation with multiple lines, is there a way to add tags on a _per-line_ basis, i.e. `\tag{1}` for line 1, `\tag{2}` for line 2, etc? If I use the `\tag{...}` commands, I can only use one per equation and it labels the entire equation, not each line.

  * Why do we need both `$$` and `\begin{equation}` with `aligned`? I noticed that when I omitted `\begin{equation}` that I did not get an equation number, but that does not happen when I use only `$$` without any other environments inside.

  * If equations are not being numbered, is there any (practical) difference between `aligned` and `align`? (I understand they **should** be used with single equations and multiple equations respectively.) I've checked the link mentioned in an earlier comment which shows several examples of differences, but none of them seem to apply when using Mathjax here on Math Stack Exchange; they use environments like `tabular` or `list` or `enumerate`, none of which are recognized by Mathjax. Also, is there any reason to use `\begin{equation}` and `\end{equation}` if equations are not being numbered?

# Linear programming

## Formulation

A theoretical LPP can be typeset as

    
    
    \begin{array}{ll}
    \text{maximize}  & c^T x \\
    \text{subject to}& d^T x = \alpha \\
    &0 \le x \le 1.
    \end{array}
    

maximizecTxsubject todTx=α0≤x≤1.

To input a numerical LPP, use `alignat` instead of `align` to get better
alignment between signs, variables and coefficients.

    
    
    \begin{alignat}{5}
      \max \quad        & z = &   x_1  & + & 12 x_2  &   &       &         && \\
      \mbox{s.t.} \quad &     & 13 x_1 & + & x_2     & + & 12x_3 & \geq 5  && \tag{constraint 1} \\
                        &     & x_1    &   &         & + & x_3   & \leq 16 && \tag{constraint 2} \\
                        &     & 15 x_1 & + & 201 x_2 &   &       & =    14 && \tag{constraint 3} \\
                        &     & \rlap{x_i \ge 0, i = 1, 2, 3}
    \end{alignat}
    

maxz=x1+12x2s.t.13x1+x2+12x3≥5x1+x3≤1615x1+201x2=14xi≥0,i=1,2,3

We treat max, z, each variable, ± sign and RHS as one separate column, while
leaving an extra empty column on the right. Then we count the number of
separators `&`, add one into this number then divide it by two. (e.g. (9 + 1)
÷ 2 = 5)

`\rlap` is used so that the last row spans over one column.

Optional: `\tag` is used to label the constraints.

## Change MATLAB/Octave matrices to LATEX code

To get fractions, execute `format rat` at the beginning.

Writing manually the LATEX code for a matrix with many rows and columns in
Octave is tedious. The Octave function

    
    
    strcat("\\begin{bmatrix}\n",strrep(strrep(mat2str(A)," "," & "), ...
    ";"," \\\\\n")(2:end-1),"\n\\end{bmatrix}\n")
    

converts

    
    
    A = [1 2 2; 2 3 4; 4 4 2]
    A =
    
       1   2   2
       2   3   4
       4   4   2
    

to

    
    
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 2 & 2 \\
    2 & 3 & 4 \\
    4 & 4 & 2
    \end{bmatrix}
    

so that pasting the generated code gives

[122234442].

## Simplex tableaux

Since the coefficient of the objective value variable z _never_ changes, my
habit is to omit the z-column to save ink.

## Units

While LATEX has packages that format units, MathJax does not. For visual
consistency, one should format units within the same string of MathJax code as
the value to which it corresponds, separating the value and unit with `\`
(space-backslash-space) since the
[BIPM](https://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/) recommends a small
space between the value and units. In addition, follow the below conventions
for formatting values and units:

### Decimal Separator & Digit Separation

Following the conventions of the English-speaking world, a period `.` should
be used to separate the decimal part of a number from the integral part, not a
comma `,` as is common in some languages. This is because commas are already
reserved for separating mathematical notation such as arguments of
multivariate functions, elements of a set, and the coordinates of ordered
tuples.

No punctuation should be used to separate multiples of three digits on either
side of the decimal separator; instead, a small space rendered by `\,` should
be used on both sides of the decimal marker when the string of digits consists
of more than four or five digits. For example,

  * `4321.1234` 4321.1234
  * `54\,321.123\,45` 54321.12345
  * `0.56789` 0.56789
  * `0.567\,89` 0.56789

If you use a decimal separator, you should include a digit on both sides of
the separator, even if the digit is simply 0.

### Powers of 10

It is preferable to write scientific or engineering notation like this:
`4.15\times10^{n}` 4.15×10n. The spacing around `\times` × is taken care of on
its own, so there is no need to insert the spacing manually.

Nevertheless, if necessary, use an upright variant of the letter ‘E’ or ‘e’ to
indicate order of magnitude, such as

  * `\mathrm{E}\,6` E6
  * `\scriptsize{\mathrm{E}}\,\normalsize{6}` E6
  * `\mathrm{e}\,6` e6

A small space on either side is perfectly fine and recommended.

### Single Units

The symbol of any unit—especially SI units—should follow the form
`\mathrm{u}`. (I have this command saved under the keyboard shortcut `usin` on
my devices.) For example,

  * `\mathrm{m}` m
  * `\mathrm{kg}` kg
  * `\mathrm{ft.}` ft.

Do not use a period with symbolic units; do use a period with abbreviated
units.

### Units with a Dot Multiplier

Multiplied units conjoined by a dot should follow the form
`\mathrm{u}\!\cdot\!\mathrm{v}` u⋅v. (I have this sequence of commands saved
under the keyboard shortcut `umul` on my devices.) Because of how `\cdot` is
designed (i.e., to separate numbers), the small negative space `\!` on either
side maintains uniform spacing throughout the whole compound unit. For
example,

  * `\mathrm{N}\!\cdot\!\mathrm{m}` N⋅m
  * `\mathrm{s}\!\cdot\!\mathrm{A}` s⋅A

Do not use `\times` × as a separator.

### Units with a Solidus Separator

Divided units conjoined by a solidus should follow the form
`\left.\mathrm{u}\middle/\mathrm{v}\right.` u/v. (I have this sequence of
commands saved under the keyboard shortcut `udiv` on my devices.) The extra
markdown is to ensure that solidus stretches the entire height of the unit,
especially when exponents are involved. For example,

  * `\left.\mathrm{J}\middle/\mathrm{s}\right.` J/s
  * `\left.\mathrm{m}\middle/\mathrm{s}^2\right.` m/s2

You may include small negative spaces `\!` on either side of the solidus if
you please.

### Exponents

Exponents can be rendered with the standard MathJax markdown. The carat and
number should immediately follow the closing brace of the `mathrm{}` argument.
For example,

  * `\mathrm{m}^2` m2
  * `\left.\mathrm{m}\middle/\mathrm{s}^2\right.` m/s2

### Parentheses

Parentheses can also be rendered with standard MathJax markdown using `\left(`
and `\right)` outside the argument of `\mathrm`. For example,

  * `\left.\mathrm{kg}\!\cdot\!\mathrm{m}^2\middle/\left(\mathrm{C}\!\cdot\!\mathrm{s}\right)\right.` kg⋅m2/(C⋅s)

### Exponents in Place of Separators

If you prefer to use no separators and only powers, separator each single
`\mathrm{}` with a small space `\,` and use exponents as necessary. For
example,

  * `\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{s}^{-2}` ms−2
  * `\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{mol}` s−1mol

### Examples in Context

    
    
    \mu_0=4\pi\times10^{-7} \ \left.\mathrm{\mathrm{T}\!\cdot\!\mathrm{m}}\middle/\mathrm{A}\right.
    

μ0=4π×10−7 T⋅m/A

    
    
    180^\circ=\pi \ \mathrm{rad}
    

180∘=π rad

    
    
    N_A = 6.022\times10^{23} \ \mathrm{mol}^{-1}
    

NA=6.022×1023 mol−1
