Preface: The Aims of This Edition
论文写作
Our Debts


## I. Research, Researchers, and Readers

[note {% include relref_bili.html %}](https://www.bilibili.com/opus/675153998359035925)
**跟读者建立联系** 永远要知道你的读者是谁，他们想要知道什么；
**读者知道什么了，他们接下来想要知道什么。**
整个论文的写作，就是跟你的读者的一个无声的交流。
跟正常的交流不一样的是说，他不是互动的，而说你要一开始就想好，整个交流应该是一个什么的过程，要想清楚读者是谁，他们需要什么。
所以你在写文章时，而写的能满足他们的需求，使得他们能信服你写的东西。


### Thinking in Print: The Uses of Research, Public and Private

* 1 Thinking in Print: The Uses of Research, Public and Private
* 1.1 What Is Research?
* 1.2 Why Write It Up?
* 1.3 Why a Formal Paper?
* 1.4 Writing Is Thinking

研究是什么：
Gather information to answer a question that solves a problem.

写作的好处：
We write to remember more accurately, understand better, and evaluate
what we think more objectively. 写作使我们，记得更加精确，理解更好以及评估我们的想法是不是客观的。
* Write to Remenber 写文章自己会记得；
* Write to Understand 写的时候会帮助你理解事情；
* Write to Test Your Thinking 写作可以用来测试我们的想法；

论文格式，是同行交流的一个协议。

**Write is Thinking**
Writing a research report is, finally, thinking with and for your readers.
If instead you find a topic that you care about, ask a question that you want to answer.

需要为读者思考：去想自己的受众要去怎么样去理解这些东西，他们会怎么去想；
写作的核心在于，要找到一个 topic（自己真正关心的问题，并且自己真的想去回答的问题，就是说去找到自己的兴趣点在哪）。


### Connecting with Your Reader: Creating a Role for Yourself and Your Readers

* 2 Connecting with Your Reader: Creating a Role for Yourself and Your Readers
* 2.1 Conversing with Your Readers
* 2.2 Understanding Your Role
* 2.3 Imagining Your Readers’ Role
* ★ Quick Tip: A Checklist for Understanding Your Readers

为你自己和读者都创建一个角色。
Research counts for little if few read it. Yet even experienced researchers sometimes forget to keep their readers in mind as they plan and draft their report. In this chapter we show you how to think about readers even before you begin your project.

读书或读论文时其实是跟作者的无声交流，写作也一样，是将自己的“声音” 写进文字里。
**Writing is an imagined conversation.**
once we decide what role to play and what role to assign to readers, those roles are fixed.

作者的角色有三种：
1. I’ve Found Some New and Interesting Information 发现了有意思的事，让大伙儿也乐乐（视频作者）
2. I’ve Found a Solution to an Important Practical Problem 找到了实际问题的解决方案（有点像写博客）
3. I’ve Found an Answer to an Important Question 找到了一个重要问题的答案，陈述问题与答案是什么（写论文）

当作者扮演不同的角色的时候，读者也会得到对应的角色。
读者的角色也有三种：
1. 娱乐我。Entertain Me 追求娱乐的人。
2. Help Me Solve My Practical Problem 需要解决实际问题的人。
3. Help Me Understand Something Better 想要更好去理解东西的人。

没有找准读者的角色，可能会造成读者反馈： **I don't care.**


### A Checklist for Understanding Your Readers

Think about your readers from the start, knowing that you’ll understand them better as you work through your project. Answer these questions early on, then revisit them when you start planning and again when you revise.

1. Who will read my report? 我们的读者是谁？谁会读我们的文章。

    * Professionals who expect me to follow every academic convention and use a standard format?
    * Well-informed general readers?
    * General readers who know little about the topic?

2. What do they expect me to do? Should I 他们希望我来干什么事情。

    * entertain them?
    * provide new factual knowledge?
    * help them understand something better?
    * help them do something to solve a practical problem in the world?

3. How much can I expect them to know already? 理解一下你的读者的知识的储备。

    * What do they know about my topic?
    * Is the problem one that they already recognize?
    * Is it one that they have but haven’t yet recognized?
    * Is the problem not theirs, but only mine?
    * Will they take the problem seriously, or must I convince them that it matters?

4. How will readers respond to the solution /answer in my main claim? 要预测读者对你的回答以及方法做的反馈。

    * Will it contradict what they already believe? How?
    * Will they make standard arguments against my solution?
    * Will they want to see the steps that led me to the solution?

整个论文的写作，就是跟你的读者的一个无声的交流。
跟正常的交流不一样的是说，他不是互动的，而说你要一开始就想好，整个交流应该是一个什么的过程，要想清楚读者是谁，他们需要什么。
所以你在写文章时，而写的能满足他们的需求，使得他们能信服你写的东西。


### 1.2 WHY WRITE IT UP?

For some of you, though, the invitation to join this conversation may still seem easy to decline. If you accept it, you’ll have to find a good question, search for sound data, formulate and support a good answer, and then write it all up. Even if you turn out a first-rate report, it may be read not by an eager world but only by your teacher.

And, besides, you may think, my teacher knows all about my topic. What do I gain from writing up my research, other than proving I can do it?

One answer is that we write not just to share our work, but to improve it before we do.

#### 1.2.1 Write to Remember

Experienced researchers first write just to remember what they’ve read. A few talented people can hold in mind masses of information, but most of us get lost when we think about what Smith found in light of Wong’s position, and compare both to the odd data in Brunelli, especially as they are supported by Boskowitz — but what was it that Smith said? When you don’t take notes on what you read, you’re likely to forget or, worse, misremember it.

#### 1.2.2 Write to Understand

A second reason for writing is to see larger patterns in what you read. When you arrange and rearrange the results of your research in new ways, you discover new implications, connections, and complications. Even if you could hold it all in mind, you would need help to line up arguments that pull in different directions, plot out complicated relationships, sort out disagreements among experts. I want to use these claims from Wong, but her argument is undercut by Smith’s data. When I put them side by side, I see that Smith ignores this last part of Wong’s argument. Aha! If I introduce it with this part from Brunelli, I can focus on Wong more clearly. That’s why careful researchers never put off writing until they’ve gathered all the data they need: they write from the beginning of their project to help them assemble their information in new ways.

#### 1.2.3 Write to Test Your Thinking

A third reason to write is to get your thoughts out of your head and onto paper, where you’ll see what you really can think. Just about all of us, students and professionals alike, believe our ideas are more compelling in the dark of our minds than they turn out to be in the cold light of print. You can’t know how good your ideas are until you separate them from the swift and muddy flow of thought and fix them in an organized form that you — and your readers — can study.

In short, we write to remember more accurately, understand better, and evaluate what we think more objectively. (And as you will discover, the more you write, the better you read.)


### 1.4 WRITING IS THINKING

Writing a research report is, finally, thinking with and for your readers. When you write for others, you disentangle your ideas from your memories and wishes, so that you — and others — can explore, expand, combine, and understand them more fully. Thinking for others is more careful, more sustained, more insightful — in short, more thoughtful — than just about any other kind of thinking.

You can, of course, take the easy way: do just enough to satisfy your teacher. This book will help you do that, but you’ll shortchange yourself if you do. If instead you find a topic that you care about, ask a question that you want to answer, then pursue that answer as best you can, your project can have the fascination of a mystery whose solution richly rewards your efforts. Nothing contributes more to successful research than your commitment to it, and nothing teaches you more about how to think than a successful (or even unsuccessful) report of its product.

We wish we could tell you how to balance your belief in the worth of your project with the need to accommodate the demands of teachers and colleagues, but we cannot. If you believe in what you’re doing and cannot find anyone else who shares your beliefs, all you can do is put your head down and press on. With our admiration.

> Some of the world’s most important research has been done by those who persevered in the face of indifference or even hostility, because they never lost faith in their vision. The geneticist Barbara McClintock struggled for years unappreciated because her research community considered her work uninteresting. But she believed in it and pressed on. When her colleagues finally realized that she had already answered questions that they were just starting to ask, she won science’s highest honor, the Nobel Prize.
